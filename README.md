DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS – PROJECT – 3 – README FILE

TWO-PHASE DISTRIBUTED COMMIT PROTOCOL

Motivation:
A good programmer writes quality code and makes others understand by adding additional
comments. Therefore, we ensure that all the technologies used in this project are taken with
utmost concern and that they give us the desired output.
Technologies used:
1) Python
2) VS-CODE
3) RPC
4) Pathlib package
5) Datetime package
6) Func-timeout package
Python download:
"Python" is one of the world's best and fastest growing programming languages that exist so
far. It is not mandatory to use python, depending on their taste, but in our project, we decided
to use python as we can find it is more efficient in importing socket, threading packages from
python. Steps will be given below on how to install python.

Steps to install:
1) Click on python 3.10.7 download for windows button and finish the final steps to intall.
2) Now after downloading the java jdk file, we need to install it in our system successfully
and need to set the path by changing the path inside environment variable.

VS-CODE:
A good idea will play a significant role in building the project; one such good idea we used in
our project is the "VS-CODE."

Steps to download:
1) Download the free community version if you are on the windows system as it is free and
open source.

2-PHASE DISTRIBUTED COMMIT PROTOCOL:

2-PHASE distributed system protocol we are using tracsaction coordinator and two others
processes which we call as node1 and node2.

Project Code Brief:
This program consists of four .py files out of which all files need to be executed which are 1
server code and 2 client code.
1) code.py
2) Node-1.py
3) Node-2.py
The entire project is written by us in PYTHON programing language. This project consists of three
programs which are node1 , node2 and co-ordinator.py.
We created these three separate python files, one for cordinator code and the other two for
nodes code implementation. So that the user can run both simultaneously and can check in the
terminal.
